    $Recorder.enable()
    $Recorder.disable()

Enable/disable recording of the events generated by `$Recorder.@record`.

!!! note

    Since Historic.jl uses the method invalidation to toggle on and off the
    recordings, the recordings inside tasks started prior to the call to
    `$Recorder.enable()`/`$Recorder.disable()` cannot be enabled/disabled.
